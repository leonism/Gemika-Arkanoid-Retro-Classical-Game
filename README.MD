## Configuration ⚙️

You can customize the game settings by modifying the `config.py` file. Here are some key configurations you can adjust:

- **Screen Dimensions**: Set the width and height of the game window.
- **FPS**: Adjust the frames per second for smooth gameplay.
- **Colors**: Customize the color scheme of your game elements.
- **Asset Paths**: Change the paths for your sound and image files if needed.

## Troubleshooting 🛠️

### ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pygame'

This indicates that Pygame is not installed. Install it using:

```bash
pip install pygame
```

Or else if you encountered the following error :

```bash
`/usr/local/bin/pip: bad interpreter: /usr/bin/python: no such file or directory`
```

This suggests that the `pip` command is pointing to a Python interpreter that does not exist on your system.

### Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Verify Python Installation**:

   ```bash
   python3 --version
   ```

2. **Install Pygame using Python3**:

   ```bash
   python3 -m ensurepip --upgrade
   python3 -m pip install pygame
   ```

3. **Running the Game**:
   ```bash
   python3 run_game.py
   ```

### Additional Tips

1. **If `pip` is not working**:

   ```bash
   python3 -m ensurepip --upgrade
   ```

2. **Check your PATH**:

   ```bash
   echo $PATH
   ```

   Ensure the correct Python binaries are in your PATH. If necessary, add Python to your PATH by modifying your `.zshrc` or `.bashrc` file:

   ```bash
   export PATH="/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.8/bin:$PATH"
   ```

3. **Use a Virtual Environment**:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install pygame
   python run_game.py
   ```

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the issues and get your Arkanoid game running smoothly. If you

encounter any further issues, please provide the specific error messages so we can assist you further.
